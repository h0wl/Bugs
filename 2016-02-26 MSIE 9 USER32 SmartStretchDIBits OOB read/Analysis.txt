MSIE 9 USER32 SmartStretchDIBits OOB read
=========================================

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted icon file can cause USER32.dll to read out of bound data.

Known affected software, attack vectors and mitigations
-------------------------------------------------------
  + MSIE 9

    An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
    webpage. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from triggering the
    vulnerable code path.


Repro
-----
repro.html:

    <style>*{cursor:url(/repro.ico)</style>

repro.ico is a binary format and therefore not shown.

Description
-----------
A truncated ico file, when loaded as a cursor in MSIE 9, can cause USER32 to
attempt to read data beyond the end of the memory allocated for the file.

Exploit
-------
The only obvious type of attack would be information disclosure. However, I
assume any data read OOB will only affect the appearance of the mouse cursor,
which the website cannot determine, so no information disclosure is possible.

Notes
-----
I allow vendors 60 days to fix an issue, unless they can provide an adequate
reason for extending this deadline. Failure to meet a deadline without an
adequate explanation will normally result in public disclosure of information
regarding the vulnerability to the general public.
